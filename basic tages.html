<pre>now i am writing pe formatted tags
       in this it will pprint as it is how we are writing
        in the code             ...dont remove any space or line breaks too....
           this helps to print what we want...........
            suppose i we dont gave pre tag then this complete lines will print contiously rmoving spaces and line breaks......
</pre>
